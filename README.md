 <br>ArmCord is a custom client designed to enhance your Discord experience while keeping everything lightweight. 
</div>

# Features

- **Standalone client** 

   ArmCord is built as a standalone client and doesn't rely on the original Discord client in anyway.


- **Various mods built in**
 
   Enjoy Cumcord, GooseMod, Flicker, and their many features, or have a more vanilla experience, it's your choice!


- **Made for Privacyâ„¢**

   ArmCord automatically blocks all of Discord's trackers; even without any client mods you can feel safe and secure!


- **Much more stable**

   ArmCord is using a newer build of Electron than the stock Discord app. This means you can have a much more stable and secure experience, along with slightly better performance.


- **Cross-platform support!**

   ArmCord was originally created for ARM64 Linux devices, since Discord doesn't support them. We soon decided to support every platform that [Electron supports](https://github.com/electron/electron#platform-support)!
